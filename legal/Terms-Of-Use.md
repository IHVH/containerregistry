## Microsoft Artifact Registry Terms of Use

Last Updated: May 2022

**Acceptance of Terms**

The Services that Microsoft provides to you are subject to the following Terms of Use ("TOU"). Microsoft reserves the right to update and modify the TOU at any time without notice to you. The most current version of the TOU can be reviewed by clicking on the "Terms of Use" hypertext link located at the bottom of our web pages. When we make updates to the TOU, Microsoft will update the date at the top of this page. By using the Services after a new version of the TOU has been posted, you agree to the terms of such new version. The Services may include features or functionality that are  in preview and may not work correctly or in the same way the final version may work.

**Description of Services**

Microsoft Artifact Registry (referred to herein as “MAR” and also known as Microsoft Container Registry or “MCR”) is the primary registry for all Microsoft-published Artifacts that offers a reliable and trustworthy delivery of container images with a syndicated catalog, while maintaining the quality that customers expect from a Microsoft product offering. Through the MAR discovery experience web properties and MAR APIs (collectively, "Services"), Microsoft provides you with access to Microsoft’s official container images and cloud-native artifacts (collectively, “Artifacts”). The Services which include any updates, enhancements, new features, and/or the addition of any new MAR discovery portal web properties or MAR APIs, are subject to the TOU. 

**Your Privacy**

Your privacy is important to us. Please read the Microsoft Privacy Statement (the "Privacy Statement") as it describes the types of data we collect from you and your devices ("Data"), how we use your Data, and the legal bases we have to process your Data. Where processing is based on consent and to the extent permitted by law, by agreeing to these TOU, you consent to Microsoft’s collection, use and disclosure of your Data as described in the Privacy Statement. 

**Artifacts**

The Services allow you to access and pull Artifacts published by Microsoft. Each Artifact is governed by the terms that are included with the Artifact materials and may be subject to limitations on usage, reproduction and/or dissemination; you are responsible for adhering to such limitations and terms. You should review the applicable terms before accessing, downloading, or acquiring any Artifacts. Any terms included with the Artifacts do not modify the TOU. Microsoft does not license any intellectual property to you from third party Package providers and is not responsible for information provided by third parties. 

**Artifact Legal Notice** 

Microsoft Artifacts are licensed under various licenses depending upon the Artifact’s content. If the Artifact has a Debian, Ubuntu or Alpine Linux base image and you want to retrieve the licenses, copyright notices or source code information for the base image and its official packages, please review the Linux Legal Metadata instructions file. If you are using a Windows based Artifact the governing licenses are referenced in the “License” section on the Artifact description page or in the Artifact itself, usually as a NOTICE or LICENSE file. All other components (whether open or closed source) are licensed as indicated either in the “License” section on the Artifact description page or in the Artifact itself.

A Artifact may incorporate material from third parties. Microsoft makes certain open source code available at https://3rdpartysource.microsoft.com, or if you want a copy of the source code in a Artifact you may send a check or money order for US $5.00, including the product name, the open source component name, and version number, to: Source Code Compliance Team, Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052 USA

**Docker Software**

Use of the Artifacts available via the Services may require that you download certain software from Docker Inc. Use of the software from Docker is governed by separate terms provided by Docker. Microsoft does not license the software to you. Microsoft is not a party to and is not bound by any separate terms between you and Docker, nor is Microsoft obligated to provide any support for the software. See Docker documentation for more information.
